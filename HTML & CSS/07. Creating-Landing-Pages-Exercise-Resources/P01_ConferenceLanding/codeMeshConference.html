            <p>When you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining
                standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of
                new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?
                Software continues to transform the world in remarkable
                ways and developers are at the center of it. At CodeMesh 2017
                we invite you to join us in Sofia to learn about
                latest new technologies and exciting plans on the horizon.
                As always, CodeMesh is filled with strong technical sessions
                as well as opportunities to meet and learn from others in
                the industry. We’ll make sure the schedule is filled with
                solid content, and will strive to deliver some fun surprises along the way.</p>
