                <h2>You can preorder Intel's Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs next week</h2>
                <p>June 14, 2017</p>
                <p>Intel formally introduced its Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processor lineup at Computex last month, but
                    at
                    the time it didn't say anything about a specific release date. It turns out that Intel was waiting
                    for
                    E3 to announce availability. Starting on June 19 (this coming Monday), some of Intel's Core-X series
                    CPUs will be available to preorder.

                <h2>Here's how Microsoft's $500 Xbox One X compares to a PC</h2>
                <p>June 12, 2017</p>
                <p>Several weeks ago Microsoft lifted the covers slightly off its new next-gen console, codenamed
                    Project
                    Scorpio. Today, the software giant took the full wraps off what is now called the Xbox One X, which
                    launches this year for $500. Here's the lowdown on how powerful Scorpio is, and how it compares to a
                    gaming PC.

                <h2>Buy a GTX 1080 or 1080 Ti, get Destiny 2 free with early beta access</h2>
                <p>June 10, 2017</p>
                <p>Nvidia's got a sweet deal lined up for its next graphics card bundle. If you buy a GTX
                    1080 or 1080
                    Ti,
                    you can snag a free copy of Destiny 2, and get in on the game's PC beta in the process. And it's not
                    just any old beta access. It's [Early] Access, according to Nvidia. Why is Early in brackets? Who
                    knows!
                    But the point is, you get Destiny 2 and can try it out before the release date on October 24.
