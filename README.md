Description

SoftUni's software engineering program aims to build all the fundamental knowledge and practical skills needed to acquire the profession of "software engineer", working with the latest software technologies and learning best practices in the field of programming.


Programming Basics - JavaScript

The "Programming Basics" course provides basic programming skills required for all technology majors at the Software University. This includes writing basic coding skills, working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing results), using conditional constructions (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).


Programming Fundamentals - JavaScript

With "Programming Fundamentals" students begin to study SoftUni's internal program for comprehensive training of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in professional modules. Learners build on the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex programming techniques and structures such as arrays, worksheets, objects and classes. Additional technologies needed by each software developer, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations and others, are studied. The basics of web development are considered, as well as one of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully builds students' understanding of upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful software developers.


JS Advanced

"JS Advanced" gain in-depth knowledge of JavaScript, such as syntax basics, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. You study more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will develop your algorithmic thinking. After successfully completing this course, you will have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, to manipulate it and to work with "events". The functional and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming will be considered, and concepts such as inheritance, object composition and prototype chain will be studied.


JS Applications

In "JS Applications" you will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. You will learn about REST Services, what a Baas (backend as a service) is and how to work with it, what asynchronous code means (Promises, using async / await), what Templating and Routing are. During the course you will create a Single Page Application, using the learned techniques from previous lectures, where you will be evaluated. You will learn what the architecture of an application is and how to properly structure your applications. At the end of the course you will look at different design templates and their practical direction, you will create your own web components using the Web Components standard and you will build a Wepback environment from scratch.
